# Forecasting-seasonal-sales
R script  forecasting sales of a good given time of the year (+ .xlsx data set)

In this repository you will find one of my assignments for Managerial Economics unit (ECON20001).

The R script provided in the repository provides answers to the questions of the assignment.

1. Plot sales for different time periods on the graph.
2. Create a linear regression model
3. Introduce dummy variables and regress sales on them.
4. Use dummy variables to forecast sales for the upcoming months & graph the forecasts
5. Create a 95% confidence interval
6. Obtain forecasts adjusted for seasonality
  (This was done by multiplying the unadjusted forecasts by the Sales to forecast ratio (S/F ratio). The S/F ratio was obtained by taking the average of actual sales from that month, and then dividing the result by the mean of forecast sales for that month.)
